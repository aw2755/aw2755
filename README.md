## 🏙 About Me

Living and coding in **Brooklyn, New York** 🏙, I’m a passionate developer with a strong love for **backend development** and **problem-solving**. I strive to build seamless web applications that function as smooth as the New York subway (on a good day!) 🚆.  

When I'm not coding, you’ll catch me playing badminton 🏸 or enjoying a coffee in one of the city's many vibrant cafes ☕️.
